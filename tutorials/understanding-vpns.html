<h2><strong><b>Understanding VPN</b></strong></h2>

<blockquote><p>The number of people using a VPN while on the internet has significantly increased over time. For those not aware, VPN stands for <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/vpn-endpoint-security-clients/what-is-vpn.html"><u>Virtual Private Network</u></a>. VPN offers an easy and effective solution if you are looking for freedom, privacy, and more security. </p></blockquote>

<p>Not familiar with the concept of a VPN? Don't worry. This page provides all substantial information that you will need to understand VPNs. It explains precisely how VPNs work and why people highly rely on it. </p>

<h2><strong><b>What is a VPN?</b></strong></h2>

<p>A VPN is programming that creates an encrypted and safe connection when on the internet using your device. It could either be your computer, tablet, or smartphone.  VPNs are mostly used when on a public internet because it is a less secure network.</p>

<p>They use tunneling protocols to encrypt and decrypt sender and recipient data. Also, the source and destination network addresses are encrypted for better security while operating online. Most importantly, VPNs provide greater privacy than even <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2019/10/29/how-to-secure-your-phones-portable-wi-fi-hotspot.html"><u>well-secured WI-FI hotspots</u></a>.</p>


<h2><strong><b>Why you need VPN services  </b></strong></h2>

<p>Transacting or web surfing on an unsecure WI-FI network exposes your browsing habits and private information. That's why a VPN is necessary, especially if you're concerned about your online privacy and security. Come to think about it, most of the things concerning our lives are taking place online.</p>

<p>For instance, we use the internet to access our bank accounts, keep in touch with friends and family members, check our medical records, and even work online. All this information could end up in wrongful hands, so you need a better security strategy to keep this data safe.</p>

<p>Securing your internet connection with a VPN reduces the risk of governments, websites, hackers, your internet providers, your employer, and any other parties finding out more about you against your will.</p>

<p>VPNs are a great deal of shielding your data from all these sights. There are many reasons you should start using a VPN, but the most important ones are security, privacy, and the freedom to browse on the internet. Pay bills, shop online and send emails without the worry of strangers eavesdropping what you are doing.</p>

<h2><strong><b>How VPNs work</b></strong></h2>
<p>You first need to find <a href="https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/choosing-a-vpn.html"><strong><u><b>a reliable VPN provider</b></u></strong></a>, then download and install their software. Once you are done, go to security settings of your choice and set-up a safe connection with your preferred VPN server.  After establishing the connection, this is what will happen to your data:</p>

<ul>
 	<li>All data traffic in your computer will be <a href="https://theprivacyguide.org/tutorials/understanding-cryptography.html"><u>encrypted</u></a>and sent to the VPN server through a protected connection.</li>
 	<li>The VPN server decrypts the encrypted data from your computer.</li>
 	<li>After decrypting, the VPN server then sends your data onto the internet, where you will receive a reply as the user.</li>
 	<li>Again, the VPN server encrypts the traffic and sends it back to you.</li>
 	<li>Lastly, the VPN software that you installed on your computer will decrypt the data for your understanding and for you to be able to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the VPN encrypts your data traffic, hackers and any other party find it more difficult to intercept and look. This kind of secure connection increases your anonymity as a user since an external VPN server reroutes internet traffic. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.bestproxyreviews.com/what-does-an-ip-address-tell-you/"><u>your unique IP address</u></a> remains hidden while browsing the web.
</p>
<p>The good thing about VPN applications is that they run in the background of your smartphone, tablet, or computer. So, you won't see anything unusual when accessing the internet. Not to mention, you can get around various online restrictions.</p>

<h2><strong><b>What does a VPN hide? </b></strong></h2>

<p>A VPN can help you hide a lot of information that you would like to keep private. Here's some of them:</p>

<h3><strong>Your devices</strong></h3>

<p>With a VPN, you can protect your computer, tablet, smartphone, and laptop from spying eyes. When you access the internet, the prime target for cybercriminals is your devices. It's, therefore, crucial to use a VPN to protect your data whenever you're on networks like a <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-risks-of-public-wi-fi.html"><u>public WI-FI</u></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Your surfing history</strong></h3>
<p>There is no secret as long as you are on the internet. All internet service providers, including yours, keep track of all the activities you do on the internet. The most website also saves your search history about everything. The good news is that it doesn't have to happen with VPNs, for it keeps your <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/4540094?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en"><u>browsing history private</u></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Your place for stream</strong></h3>
<p>Those who like watching things like professional sports and pay for <a href="https://phreesite.com/free-movie-streaming-sites/"><u>streaming services</u></a> will need a VPN. Some streaming services are not available in other countries, especially when you travel, but with a VPN, you can select your country's IP address. Besides accessing your favorite shows, you will be able to avoid speed and data throttling.</p>
<h3><strong>Your current location and IP address</strong></h3>
<p>Web browsers keep track of your location when on the internet with the help of your IP address. Anyone could also <a href="https://www.vpntorrents.com/what-is-my-ip/"><u>capture Your IP address</u></a> and know what you searched on the internet leading back to your device. However, a VPN helps you do your search anonymously since it uses a different IP address. Your search history won't be viewed, gathered, or even sold.</p>
<h3><strong>Your web activities</strong></h3>
<p>If you want your internet freedom to be protected, VPN is the way to go. Remember, it prevents anyone from seeing your browsing history, including the government surveillance team that might ask your internet service provider to record your internet activities.</p>
<h2><strong><b>Final thoughts </b></strong></h2>
<p>While on the internet, your security and privacy are crucial, hence the need to use a VPN, which offers you a secure connection. Subscribe to a VPN provider of your choice, and no one, including the government or employer, will have to see or trace what you do with your devices.</p>
